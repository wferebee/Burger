# Burger - Eat Da Burger

## ABOUT
  * Eat Da Burger is a full stack application that allows the user to create burger names, and then... devour them!
  * This app has a spooky feel to it but feel free to be creative and use your own imagination when thinking up your perfect burger name.

# HOW IT WORKS
 * Users enter their imagined burger name.
 * Requests are sent to save the burger name in the database.
 * Then all of the existing burgers are populated in the Ready to Eat section of the website.
 * After that the user can virtually eat the burger by clicking on it's name.
 * Then the data for the burger is modified and requests are sent again and the burger name is then populated in the Devoured Burgers section.
